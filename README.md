EVENING SKATING

The Evening Skating website is the main source for finding information and getting in contact with the free activity project called Evening Skating, made by the city of Stockholm as part of the free communal services that they offer.

Evening Skating is made with the intent that everyone should be able (in a free and easy accessible form) to use the ice skating facilities (outdoors aswell as indoors) that the city offers. Therefore, it's suitable for all ages and backgrounds. This means that whether you are an experienced skater looking for a nice exercise, or a parent looking for a fun activity for the whole family, it's customized to fit all.

Furthermore, since the ice skating facilities are used by a range of different sports teams and schools (icehockey, figure skating, short track etc.) the free skating that this project offers is set during the evening (hence the name, "Evening Skating"). It will however have two time slots, one early and one late, where the early one is prioritized for the families and children under the age of 18.
