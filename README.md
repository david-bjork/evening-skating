EVENING SKATING

The Evening Skating website is the main source for finding information and getting in contact with the free activity project called Evening Skating, made by the city of Stockholm as part of the free communal services that they offer.



THE INTRODUCTION TO THE SITE SECTION

This section covers the main strokes about what the website offers and its purpose. It also goes in to more detail about the different alterantives and the reasons behind them.


CODE CREDITED TO OTHER SOURCES

All code that is not mine should have a commit where it says so. The source has been the Love Running project.


TESTING FOR BUGS

The bugs that I fixed were:

1. Changing all the <h1> elements to <h2> elements (except the first one in the header), since there is only one time which it can be used on the website format that I had.

2. Added a closing tag to the <aside> element in the Introduction to site section.

The testing for bus was used via https://validator.w3.org/ and https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
